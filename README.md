# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This script conducts an analysis on Titanic passenger data to predict survival using logistic regression models and evaluates their performance. Initially, it loads the data from two CSV files, `TitanicData.csv` and `DataForPredictionTitanic.csv`, representing the training and test datasets, respectively. The data undergoes preprocessing steps such as converting categorical variables to factors, handling missing values, and creating an encoded survival variable. Subsequently, logistic regression models are fitted to the training data, with one model incorporating predictors such as passenger class, sex, age, and number of siblings/spouses aboard, while the other model utilizes only sex and age as predictors. Predictions are then made on the test data using these models, and their performance is evaluated using confusion matrices and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This analysis aims to determine the effectiveness of logistic regression in predicting survival on the Titanic dataset and compare the performance of models with different sets of predictors.
